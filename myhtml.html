<h1 id="top">Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
<h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
<p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler
    than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet <i>high</i>. Many of the
    residents are <em>high</em>, too.

    (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)

<h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
<p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text </p>
<h2 class="emphasized">Some people italicize and bold too much.</h2>
<p>I <em>really</em> feel that <span class="emphasized">some</span> writers use <i>way</i> too much bold and an <strong>incredible
    amount</strong> of italics when they could use <b>far fewer</b> of these text effects.
<p>This is going to be a <span class="standout">red letter</span></p>
<p class="pretty">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along,
    justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any
    word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a
    block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between
    words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>
<blockquote><p>By default, a blockquote is set in. Optionally, you can also style it, as I do here by specifying grey in
    the CSS. Frequently, designers also change the size of blockquote text, making it either smaller or larger than
    normal text. And, of course, you can change the font-family if you want to. But avoid fancy fonts, please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="offset">This paragraph has extra whitespace all around it. Offsetting text this way signals to the reader that
    the content is outside the flow of the main body of text.</p>
<h2 class="enclosed">Later, you'll learn to use borders more aesthetically.</h2>
<h4>Centered headings are classy.</h4>
<p class="mid">In general, it's best to center short text, like headings and paragraphs that contain just a few words.
    When you center longer passages, even a couple of sentences like this, you make the text hard to read and give an
    impression of flakiness.
</p>
<p id="special">This paragraph has a unique id.</p>
<div id="main">
    <h2>Here's the whole story</h2>
    <p>It's soft</p>
    <p>It is fluffy</p>
</div>
<div id="midpage">
    <h2>This is a heading inside the div.</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph inside the div. The heading inherits the font-family of the div because no font-family has
        been assigned to h2 headings in the CSS file. Paragraphs, on the other hand, have been styled with Georgia and
        its relatives. The specific styling for paragraphs overrides the styling of the div. If you want paragraphs
        inside the div to display in Arial and its relatives like the heading, you'd have to style these paragraphs
        specifically, with a class of their own.</p>

<p>Deep-rooted beliefs about the supernatural powers of slow lorises, such as their purported abilities to ward off evil
    spirits or to cure wounds, have popularized their use in traditional medicine. Due in part to the large eyes that
    are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle, they have also been popularized as 'cute' pets in viral videos on
    YouTube.</p>
